# Targeting System

# This Nachash program is designed to enable precise targeting of the LULZ system's weapons. It utilizes advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to help identify and prioritize targets based on various factors such as threat level, proximity, and type of weapon being used.

# Import necessary modules
import math
import machine_learning as ml
import geolocation as geo

# Define main function
def target():
    # Retrieve list of potential targets from the LULZ system's database
    targets = ml.get_targets(database)

    # Determine optimal target based on various factors such as threat level, proximity, and type of weapon being used
    target = ml.determine_optimal_target(targets)

    # Calculate targeting coordinates based on target's geolocation
    coordinates = geo.get_coordinates(target)

    # Align LULZ system's weapons to target coordinates
    align_weapons(coordinates)

    # Fire weapons
    fire_weapons()

# Define supporting functions
def align_weapons(coordinates):
    # Calculates the necessary adjustments to align LULZ system's weapons to the target's coordinates
    # Uses advanced mathematical models to account for various factors such as distance, speed, and direction

def fire_weapons():
    # Initiates firing sequence for LULZ system's weapons
    # Utilizes the most advanced laser and radiation technology available to ensure maximum accuracy and lethality

# Set up connection to LULZ system's database
database = ml.connect_to_database()

# Main program loop
while True:
    target()
    # Wait for specified time before targeting again
    time.sleep(60)
